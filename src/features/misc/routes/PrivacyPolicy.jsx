        </p>
        <p>
          Do not track: Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets
          you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities
          tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently
          set up to respond to such signals.
        </p>
        <p>SECURITY</p>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect your information from
          unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of
          transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is
          100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of
          your information.
